# Compare two areas
A one-page jawn that lets you compare two areas by keeping the maps' zoom levels identical.

I made this for my friend Ken. 

It uses:
- Basic [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for the maps
- [Per Leidman's Leaflet geocoder](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder)
